Objective: The objective of the project is to build a predictive model for forecasting the price of crude oil in the global market.

Data Collection: Data will be collected from various sources such as financial news, historical prices, global demand, supply data, geopolitical events, and other relevant data points.

Data Preparation: Data cleaning and data pre-processing will be performed to ensure the quality of the data. Data normalization and standardization techniques will also be applied to prepare the data for analysis.

Feature Selection: Feature selection techniques will be used to identify the most important variables that affect the crude oil prices.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis will be performed to understand the patterns and relationships in the data, as well as to identify any outliers or anomalies.

Model Selection: Various statistical and machine learning algorithms will be evaluated to select the best model that can accurately predict the crude oil prices.

Model Training: The selected model will be trained using the historical data to learn the patterns and relationships in the data.

Model Validation: The trained model will be validated using a hold-out dataset to ensure that it can generalize well to new data.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model will be evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Deployment: The final model will be deployed in a production environment to make predictions on new data.

Monitoring: The model's performance will be monitored regularly, and if necessary, the model will be retrained or updated to improve its accuracy.

Communication: The results of the project will be communicated to stakeholders, including executives, investors, and other interested parties.
